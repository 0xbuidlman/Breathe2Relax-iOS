<p>
Diaphragmatic breathing has widely known benefits in reduction of stress, tension and anxiety - calming the body’s “fight or flight” response to better focus the mind and the body. The Breathe2Relax application is a portable skill rehearsal tool for practicing diaphragmatic breathing.  It can be used as a standalone stress reducer or augment face-to-face care with a healthcare professional. Due to its portability, this guided exercise is easily accessible when it is needed most.
