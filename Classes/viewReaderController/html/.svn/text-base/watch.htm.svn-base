<h1 class="header">“How To” Breathe</h1>
<p>
Now, to better understand how breathing affects your relaxation response, it helps to know a bit about the biology behind it.
</p>

<h2 class="header">The Diaphragm</h2>

<p>
Your lungs span from the top of your chest down to your diaphragm.  The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle under your lungs that rises and falls as you breathe.    When you inhale deeply, the diaphragm presses down: your stomach pooches out and your lungs expand, pulling in air and oxygenating your blood. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up, pressing air out of your lungs and releasing your belly so that it sinks in again.
</p>

<h2 class="header">Chest versus Diaphragmatic Breathing</h2>

<p>
Now, there are two main types of breathing: chest and diaphragmatic breathing. Chest breathing is shallow and rapid. It doesn’t fully expand your lungs, and starves your lower lobes of oxygen. When you breathe with your chest, there’s less oxygen in your blood and fewer nutrients to sustain your body.  Your body then senses that the blood and tissues are in need of fuel and will continue in an activated state of stress until its needs are met. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Diaphragmatic</em>, or belly breathing, takes advantage of the full range of movement of your diaphragm. It’s how babies and children naturally breathe, and it’s probably how you breathe when you’re asleep or relaxed. Diaphragmatic breathing activates the relaxation response by supplying an excess of oxygen to the blood, which then ‘tops off’ the oxygen and energy reserves in the body’s tissues.  This creates a reserve of oxygen rich fuel for the body to draw upon, when needed, and contributes to balancing your emotions.  As the body senses this energy reserve, it then begins to relax.

<h2 class="header">Chest or Belly…How Do I Know?</h2>

<p>
For many of us, breathing with our chests is a habit, and it feels strange when we practice belly breathing and feel our stomachs rise and fall. But, here’s an easy way to start mastering belly breathing.
</p>

<p>
First, find a quiet place where you know you won’t be disturbed.  Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Put one hand on your upper chest and one on your belly, just below your rib cage. Close your eyes and breathe in slowly through your nose.  You’ll feel the hand on your belly rise noticeably, while the hand on your chest will barely move. Then tighten up your stomach muscles and slowly exhale, allowing the air to gradually escape through your lips. The hand on your stomach will fall quite a bit, while the hand on your upper chest will hardly move.
</p>

<p>
When you’re first learning how to belly breathe, you might find it easier to follow these instructions while lying down. You might also want to try putting a book on your belly: that way you can watch it rise and fall while you practice, letting you know that you’re breathing deeply with your diaphragm instead of shallowly with your chest.  Pay attention to the flow of your breath.  Strive to make it smooth and gentle.  Try to find a steady rhythm in your breathing.
</p>

<p>
As you become more comfortable with belly breathing, try doing it sitting up. Even if it’s hard at first, you’ll find that it will get easier and more automatic over time.  Be patient.  Although “breathing” sounds like it should be easy to do, diaphragmatic breathing takes practice.  It is important that you feel comfortable with this type of breathing before you move onto the guided breathing exercise. When you’re ready you can move onto the diaphragmatic breathing exercise by selecting PRACTICE from the main menu
