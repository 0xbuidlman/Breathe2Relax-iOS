<h1 class="header">What is Stress?</h1>
<h2 class="header">Biology of Stress</h2>

<p >
Stress is a normal response. When you’re faced with challenges and threats, your body and mind react. Your brain kicks into high gear, focusing your attention and preparing you to act quickly. This is called the stress response, and is a normal reaction to a challenge.
</p>

<p >
Think of it like driving a car. The stressful situation is like a green light telling your brain to “step on the gas.” This causes adrenaline and stress hormones to start pumping through your blood stream, affecting how you feel, think, and act. As you pick up speed, you “accelerate” into an automatic state of high alert: this is called the “fight-or-flight” response. Your heart beats faster and the blood vessels in your large muscles widen, allowing more blood to flow where it’s needed most. You start to sweat so that your body doesn’t overheat, and your muscles tense, poised for action. Your vision becomes sharper and you focus intensely on any potential threats. Your body is primed and your mind, alert.  
</p>

<h2 class="header">Consequences of Stress</h2>

<p >
The stress response isn’t always a bad thing. It helps you deal with real threats, and is completely normal. But if your mind and body don’t return to a state of calm when the threat’s removed – if stress lingers or is too intense, or if your body stays trapped in a state of “fight or flight” for too long – your overall well-being will suffer.
</p>

<p >
Think about driving that car. If you keep your foot on the gas and keep accelerating, you know you’re heading straight for disaster. You might be able to run a few red lights or dodge a collision or two, but eventually and inevitable, you’re going to crash.
</p>

<p >
Short term, that crash might look like this: you’ll screw up on your job, and your relationships with family and friends will begin to fall apart. When you’re too hyped up on stress hormones, you’re more likely to miss important details, misread situations, and perform poorly on everyday tasks.
</p>

<p >
Long term, that crash can be even worse. Too much stress – too many of those stress hormones, for too long – can damage your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds, infections and disease. Too much stress can cause heart disease. And too much stress can cause you to suffer mood changes like depression and anxiety – which in turn can create more stress. Fact is, too much stress can be deadly.
</p>

<h2 class="header">Breathing to Control the Stress Response</h2>

<p >
So, your body automatically shifts into “high gear” when you’re faced with a stressful situation, and you know you need to “down shift” and de-accelerate, but how? How do you consciously slow down your heart rate, relax your tensed muscles, stop sweating, escape from “fight or flight” mode, and relax? 
</p>

<p >
One of the easiest ways is by controlling your breathing. Controlling your breathing is like putting on the brakes: it slows down your body’s responses and brings you back to a restful state of calm. Controlling your breathing turns off your brain’s “fight or flight” circuit and turns on its “rest and digest” circuit. Controlling your breathing gets you out of a state of high alert.  
</p>

<p >
Although simply taking a few controlled breaths when you’re stressed can be helpful all by itself, there are some specific breathing techniques you can learn that will do much more to restore you to a state of calm and well being. One of these is called diaphragmatic breathing, and involves breathing from your belly. It’s not hard to master, and you can learn how to do it by selecting WATCH from the main menu. 
</p>

<h2 class="header">Resilience: A Stronger Mind and Body</h2>

<p >
Research confirms what real-life experience shows: relaxation exercises like diaphragmatic breathing help manage stress, focus the mind, and improve overall health and well being. Learning how to slow down your breathing is a great way to counter your mind and body’s response to stress, and to increase your overall resilience.  
</p>

<p >
Retraining your breathing, though, takes practice – just like strengthening your muscles or improving your athletic abilities. It’s worth it, because as you practice controlling your breath, you’ll find that it gets easier and easier – and the benefits get greater and greater.
