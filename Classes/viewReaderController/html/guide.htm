Welcome to <i>Breathe2Relax</i>!
</h2>

<p>
We've all heard the words "take a deep breath" when someone who cares about us wants to help us calm down. And we all know how good it feels to take a really deep breath when we're agitated or upset. With Breathe2Relax<!--<sup class="Registered">&#0153;</sup>-->, you've got a portable tool you can use to learn how to breathe deeply and reduce stress whenever you need to. Because you can access Breathe2Relax via your mobile phone, you'll always have Breathe2Relax handy when you need it most.
</p>

<p>
To get started, here's some quick info on each of the sections in this application:
</p>

<h2 class="header">Step 1: LEARN</h2>

<p>
The LEARN section is a great place to start. Here you'll gain useful knowledge about your body's stress response, and you'll come to understand why deep breathing is so beneficial.
</p>

<h2 class="header">Step 2: WATCH</h2>

<p>
In the WATCH section, you'll learn the difference between shallow chest breathing and deeper, more calming <i>diaphragmatic</i> or <i>belly breathing</i>. You'll see how to use your body's primary breathing muscle, the diaphragm, to draw air deeply into your lungs. This is a step you won't want to miss.
</p>

<h2 class="header">Step 3: PRACTICE</h2>

<p>
Listening to this guided narration is a great way for you to get the hang of deep breathing and to be easily guided to a more relaxed state. As you become more familiar with the technique, you can use the panel to customize your practice with audio and visuals that appeal to you.
</p>

<p>
You can also rate your stress levels both before and after practicing. The easy-to-use stress tracker records your scores in the dashboard so you can see your progress over time.
</p>

<p>
Remember that practice makes perfect. Don't feel discouraged if you don't get this right the first time because it gets easier and more automatic the more often you do it. Deep belly breathing is a great way to reduce stress and you'll see increased benefits the longer you keep at it!
</p>

<h2 class="header">Step 4: TRACK</h2>

<p>
The TRACK feature lets you store all your ratings in a graph so you can compare your scores over time. This helps you figure out what things in your life are the most stressful, things like staff meetings, sleepless nights, or rush-hour traffic. By understanding what events trigger the most stress for you, you'll be better able to manage and reduce your stress head on with breathing exercises and self care.
</p>

<p>
The TRACK feature also gives you a journal you can use to keep track of your thoughts and anything else you want to remember. Say you've found that a room in your house - the bedroom, maybe, or the den - is the place where it's easiest for you to relax and practice your breathing - or maybe you've noticed that it's easiest for you to practice your deep breathing exercises first thing after you wake up in the morning. You can jot these thoughts down in your journal so you can remember them later.
</p>

<p>
You'll also find in the Track feature some great pointers for ways to improve and troubleshoot your breathing practice, as well as some general health and wellness tips.
