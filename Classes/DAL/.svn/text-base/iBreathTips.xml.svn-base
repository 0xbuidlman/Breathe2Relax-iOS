		<tip number="46" text="Try to overcome isolation by making a plan to hang out with others. For example, plan to make at least 1 phone call per day.

Talk about how you’ve grown or changed for the better or how you are coping."/>

		<tip number="53" text="Remember that no one is perfect and that goal achievement is a process. Reflect on your successes and strengths to learn to overcome obstacles."/>
